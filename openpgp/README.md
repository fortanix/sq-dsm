This crate aims to provide a complete implementation of OpenPGP as
defined by [RFC 4880] as well as some extensions (e.g., [RFC
6637], which describes ECC cryptography for OpenPGP.  This
includes support for unbuffered message processing.

A few features that the OpenPGP community considers to be
deprecated (e.g., version 3 compatibility) have been left out.  We
have also updated some OpenPGP defaults to avoid foot guns (e.g.,
we selected modern algorithm defaults).  If some functionality is
missing, please file a bug report.

A non-goal of this crate is support for any sort of high-level,
bolted-on functionality.  For instance, [RFC 4880] does not define
trust models, such as the web of trust, direct trust, or TOFU.
Neither does this crate.  [RFC 4880] does provide some mechanisms
for creating trust models (specifically, UserID certifications),
and this crate does expose those mechanisms.

We also try hard to avoid dictating how OpenPGP should be used.
This doesn't mean that we don't have opinions about how OpenPGP
should be used in a number of common scenarios (for instance,
message validation).  But, in this crate, we refrain from
expressing those opinions; we will expose an opinionated,
high-level interface in the future.  In order to figure out the
most appropriate high-level interfaces, we look at existing users.
If you are using Sequoia, please get in contact so that we can
learn from your use cases, discuss your opinions, and develop a
high-level interface based on these experiences in the future.

Despite —or maybe because of— its unopinionated nature we found
it easy to develop opinionated OpenPGP software based on Sequoia.

# Experimental Features

This crate implements functionality from [RFC 4880bis], notably
AEAD encryption containers.  As of this writing, this RFC is still
a draft and the syntax or semantic defined in it may change or go
away.  Therefore, all related functionality may change and
artifacts created using this functionality may not be usable in
the future.  Do not use it for things other than experiments.

[RFC 4880bis]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-openpgp-rfc4880bis-08

This crate aims to provide a complete implementation of OpenPGP as
defined by RFC 4880 as well as several extensions (e.g., RFC 6637,
which describes ECC cryptography for OpenPGP, and RFC 4880bis, the
draft of the next OpenPGP standard).  This includes support for
unbuffered message processing.

# Feature flags

This crate uses *features* to enable or disable optional
functionality.  You can tweak the features in your `Cargo.toml` file,
like so:

```toml
sequoia-openpgp = { version = "*", default-features = false, features = ["crypto-nettle", ...] }
```

By default, Sequoia is built using Nettle as cryptographic backend
with all compression algorithms enabled.

Note that if you use `default-features = false`, you need to
explicitly enable a crypto backend.

## Crypto backends

Sequoia supports multiple cryptographic libraries that can be selected
at compile time.  Currently, these libraries are available:

  - The Nettle cryptographic library.  This is the default backend,
    and is selected by the default feature set.  If you use
    `default-features = false`, you need to explicitly include
    the `crypto-nettle` feature to enable it.

  - The Windows Cryptography API: Next Generation (CNG).  To select
    this backend, use `default-features = false`, and explicitly
    include the `crypto-cng` feature to enable it.  Currently, the CNG
    backend requires at least Windows 10.

## Compression algorithms

Use the `compression` flag to enable support for all compression
algorithms, `compression-deflate` to enable *DEFLATE* and *zlib*
compression support, and `compression-bzip2` to enable *bzip2*
support.

# Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV)

`sequoia-openpgp` requires Rust 1.48.
