//! Brings the most relevant types and traits into scope for working
//! with packets.
//!
//! Less often used types and traits that are more likely to lead to a
//! naming conflict are not brought into scope.  For instance, the
//! markers [`PublicParts`], etc. are not imported to avoid potential
//! naming conflicts.  Instead, they should be accessed as
//! [`key::PublicParts`].  And, [`user_attribute::Subpacket`] is not
//! imported, because it is rarely used.  If required, it should be
//! imported explicitly.
//!
//! [`PublicParts`]: key::PublicParts
//! [`user_attribute::Subpacket`]: user_attribute::Subpacket
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```
//! # #![allow(unused_imports)]
//! # use sequoia_openpgp as openpgp;
//! use openpgp::packet::prelude::*;
//! ```
