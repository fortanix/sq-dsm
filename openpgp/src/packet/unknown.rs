    /// properties]: pre-image resistance, second pre-image
    /// resistance, and collision resistance.  If an attacker can
    /// influence the signed data, then the hash algorithm needs to
    /// have both second pre-image resistance, and collision
    /// resistance.  If not, second pre-image resistance is
    /// sufficient.

    ///   [three security properties]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function#Properties

    /// signatures.  But direct key signatures, and binding signatures
    /// are only over data fully determined by signer.  And, an
    /// attacker's control over self signatures over User IDs is
    /// limited due to their structure.
    ///
    /// These observations can be used to extend the life of a hash
    /// algorithm after its collision resistance has been partially
    /// compromised, but not completely broken.  For more details,
