sq-dsm
======

This fork of [Sequoia-PGP][Sequoia] leverages
[sdkms-client-rust][sdkms-client-rust] to perform OpenPGP operations with keys
stored in the [Fortanix Data Security Manager][DSM], adding options to the
existing CLI Sequoia frontend, `sq`.

### Motivation

Sequoia-PGP defines the [Decryptor][sequoia::Decryptor] and
[Signer][sequoia::Signer] traits for low-level cryptographic operations
with secret key material, and abstracts over these traits for PGP formatting.
This fork implements Decryptor and Signer for secrets stored inside
Fortanix DSM, enabling the production of PGP material without the need to
export private keys.

### Additional requirements

Install requirements for [rust-mbedtls][rust-mbedtls]. The following
variables need to be set in order to communicate with DSM.

- `FORTANIX_API_ENDPOINT`, your DSM API endpoint,
- `FORTANIX_API_KEY`, your app's API key. It overrides `FORTANIX_PKCS12_ID`.
- `FORTANIX_PKCS12_ID`, the absolute path of a PKCS12 identity file, for
  certificate-based authentication. Given a PKCS8 pair `private.key` and
  `public.crt`, the public certificate needs to be configured in DSM for your
  app, and the PKCS12 file can be generated with e.g.
  ```
  openssl pkcs12 -export -out identity.pfx -inkey private.key -in public.crt
  ```
  If a password is set for the PKCS12 file, then `sq-dsm` will ask for it on
  each key usage (which can happen several times on one PGP operation), unless
  the `FORTANIX_PKCS12_PASSPHRASE` environment variable is set (see below).
- `FORTANIX_PKCS12_PASSPHRASE`, the passphrase to unlock the identity file
  generated above. If the password is incorrect, `sq-dsm` will ask for it on
  each operation.
- `FORTANIX_APP_UUID`, the UUID of your DSM app, for certificate-based
  authentication (e.g., this environment variable is used together with
  `FORTANIX_PKCS12_ID`).

### Example usage of added options

In the following example, Alice holds a PGP key whose secrets are stored in
DSM, and Bob and Charlie hold regular PGP keys.

1. Generate a DSM key for Alice, and local keys for Bob and Charlie
```
$  sq key generate --dsm-key="alice" --cipher-suite="nistp521" --userid="Alice <alice@example.com>"
$  sq key generate --cipher-suite="rsa3k" --userid="Bob <bob@example.com>" --export="bob.asc"
$  sq key generate --userid="Charlie <charlie@example.com>" --export="charlie.asc"
```

2. Recover Alice's Transferable Public Key (TPK)
```
$ sq key extract-cert --dsm-key="alice" > alice.asc
```

3. Create a file, sign it with Alices's key, and verify it
```
$ echo "Hello, World!" > msg.txt

$ sq sign --dsm-key="alice" msg.txt > msg.txt.signed

$ sq verify --signer-cert=alice.asc msg.txt.signed
Good signature from B4C961DE2204FD02
Hello, World!
1 good signature.
```

4. Encrypt a file to Alice, signed by Bob, and decrypt it
```
$ sq encrypt --recipient-cert=alice.asc --signer-key=bob.asc msg.txt > to_alice.asc
$ sq decrypt --dsm-key="alice" --signer-cert=bob.asc to_alice.asc
Encrypted using AES with 256-bit key
Compressed using ZIP
Good signature from DC4358B3EA20F2C6
Hello, World!
1 good signature.
```

5. Encrypt a file to Charlie, signed by both Alice and Bob, and decrypt it
```
$ sq encrypt --recipient-cert=charlie.asc --signer-dsm-key=alice --signer-key=bob.asc msg.txt > to_charlie.asc
$ sq decrypt --recipient-key=charlie.asc --signer-cert=alice.asc --signer-cert=bob.asc to_charlie.asc
Encrypted using AES with 256-bit key
Compressed using ZIP
Good signature from B4C961DE2204FD02
Good signature from DC4358B3EA20F2C6
Hello, World!
2 good signatures.
```

Sequoia PGP
===========

Sequoia is a cool new OpenPGP implementation.  It consists of several
crates, providing both a low-level and a high-level API for dealing
with OpenPGP data.

Low-level API
-------------

The low-level API can be found in the [openpgp](./openpgp) crate.
This crate
aims to provide a complete implementation of OpenPGP as defined by RFC
4880 as well as several extensions (e.g., RFC 6637, which describes
ECC cryptography for OpenPGP, and RFC 4880bis, the draft of the next
OpenPGP standard).  This includes support for unbuffered message
processing.

The [openpgp](./openpgp) crate tries hard to avoid dictating how
OpenPGP should
be used.  This doesn't mean that we don't have opinions about how
OpenPGP should be used in a number of common scenarios (for instance,
message validation).

High-level API
--------------

The high-level API can be found in the [sequoia](.) crate, which
conveniently includes all the other crates.  The high-level API
include a public key store, and network access routines.

Please note that as of this writing the high-level API is very
incomplete.

Command line interface
----------------------

Sequoia includes a simple frontend `sq` (crate [sq](./sq)) that
can be used to experiment with Sequoia and OpenPGP. It is also an
example of how to use various aspects of Sequoia.


Foreign Function Interface
--------------------------

Sequoia provides a C API for use in languages other than Rust.  The
glue code for the low-level interface can be found in the
'sequoia-openpgp-ffi' crate, glue for the high-level interface in the
'sequoia-ffi' crate.

Project status
==============

The low-level API is quite feature-complete and can be used encrypt,
decrypt, sign, and verify messages.  It can create, inspect, and
manipulate OpenPGP data on a very low-level.

The high-level API is effectively non-existent, though there is some
functionality related to key servers and key stores.

The foreign function interface provides a C API for some of Sequoia's
low- and high-level interfaces, but it is incomplete.

There is a mostly feature-complete command-line verification tool for
detached messages called ['sqv'].

LICENSE
=======

version 2 or any later version.  See the file
[LICENSE.txt](LICENSE.txt) or visit
https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-2.0.html for details.

Using Sequoia
=============

If you want to use Sequoia from Rust, you can simply register the
dependency in your `Cargo.toml` file as with any other project.

```toml
sequoia-openpgp = "*"
```

Note that we depend on a number of C libraries, which must be present
along with their development packages. See **Requirements** section
below.

Besides being a Rust crate, we also provide a C API, and bindings to
other languages, see **Bindings**.

Features
--------

Sequoia is currently supported on a variety of platforms.

### Cryptography

By default it uses the Nettle cryptographic library (version 3.4.1 or
up) but it can be used with different cryptographic backends. At the
time of writing, it also supports the native Windows [Cryptographic
API: Next Generation (CNG)].

Various backends can be enabled via Cargo features,
e.g. `crypto-nettle` or `crypto-cng` and exactly one can be enabled at
a time.

Currently, the `crypto-nettle` feature is enabled by default -
regardless of the operating system used. If you choose to enable a
different backend, please make sure to disable the default first.

### Example

To use the Windows CNG backend, use:

```toml
# Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
sequoia-openpgp = { version = "*", default-features = false, features = ["crypto-cng"] }
```

```bash
# When building locally
$ cargo build --manifest-path=openpgp/Cargo.toml --no-default-features --features crypto-cng
```

### Note

If you are developing a crate that depends on Sequoia, please ensure
the users can opt into different backends. This is done by:

- disabling default features for `sequoia-openpgp`
- providing top-level features for your crate that correspond to
  `crypto-*` ones in `sequoia-openpgp`
- (Optionally) Select one by default yourself

Like so:
```toml
# Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
sequoia-openpgp = { version = "*", default-features = false }
[features]
# Pick a Sequoia backend enabled by default
default = ["seqouia-openpgp/crypto-nettle"]
# .. but allow others to select a different backend, as well
crypto-cng = ["sequoia-openpgp/crypto-cng"]
crypto-nettle = ["sequoia-openpgp/crypto-nettle"]
```

Once Cargo target-specific default features are [implemented], it will
be possible to automatically select a backend depending on the
operating system used.

[implemented]: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/1197#issuecomment-590385530

### Compression

By default, Sequoia supports compression via `flate2` and `bzip2`
crates, enabled by `compression-deflate` and `compression-bzip2` Cargo
features respectively (also available via `compression` shorthand
feature).

Building Sequoia
================

Using Cargo
-----------

To build all Sequoia components, simply execute `cargo build
[--release] --all`.  Individual components may be built independently,
e.g. to build `sq`, run `cargo build [--release] -p sequoia-sq`, or
build `sequoia-openpgp-ffi` to build a shared object with the C API.

Using Docker
------------

The command line tool `sq` can also be built using Docker:

```shell
$ docker build -t sq .
$ docker run --rm -i sq --help
```

For example retrieving a certificate and inspecting its contents:

```shell
$ docker run --rm -i sq keyserver get 653909A2F0E37C106F5FAF546C8857E0D8E8F074 > cert.asc
$ docker run --rm -i sq packet dump < cert.asc
```

## Requirements

To build Sequoia, you need at least Rust 1.56 and a few libraries,
notably the Nettle cryptographic library version 3.4.1 or up.  Please
see below for OS-specific commands to install the needed libraries:

### Debian

```shell
$ sudo apt install git rustc cargo clang libclang-dev make pkg-config nettle-dev libssl-dev capnproto libsqlite3-dev
```

Notes:

  - You need at least `rustc` version 1.56.  This is the version included in
    Debian 12 (bookworm) at the time of writing.  You can use [rustup] if your
    distribution only includes an older Rust version.
  - You need at least Nettle 3.4.1.  Both the versions in Debian 10 (Buster)
    and Debian 11 (Bullseye) are fine.

[rustup]: https://rustup.rs/

### Arch Linux

```shell
$ sudo pacman -S git cargo clang make pkg-config nettle openssl capnproto sqlite3 --needed
```

### Fedora

```shell
$ sudo dnf install git rustc cargo clang make pkg-config nettle-devel openssl-devel capnproto sqlite-devel
```

### NixOS

Development environment for use with `nix-shell` or `direnv`:
<details>
  <summary>
    `shell.nix`
  </summary>

```nix
let
  oxalica_overlay = import (builtins.fetchTarball
    "https://github.com/oxalica/rust-overlay/archive/master.tar.gz");
  nixpkgs = import <nixpkgs> { overlays = [ oxalica_overlay ]; };
  rust_channel = nixpkgs.rust-bin.fromRustupToolchainFile ./rust-toolchain;

  hardeningDisable = [ "fortify" ];

  # compilation of -sys packages requires manually setting LIBCLANG_PATH
  LIBCLANG_PATH = "${pkgs.llvmPackages.libclang.lib}/lib";
}
```

</details>


### macOS

#### MacPorts

```shell
$ sudo port install cargo rust capnproto nettle pkgconfig coreutils
```

#### Brew

```shell
$ brew install rust capnp nettle
```

If building the transitive dependency `nettle-sys` reports missing `libclang.dylib` file make sure that `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` is set correctly:

```shell
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/lib/
```

### Windows

Please make sure to preserve line-endings when cloning the Sequoia
repository.  The relevant git option is `core.autocrlf` which must be
set to `false`.

#### MSYS2

You can install the needed libraries with the following command:

```shell
$ pacboy -S base-devel toolchain:x clang:x bzip2:x nettle:x sqlite3:x capnproto:x
```

Due to Gitlab's Windows Shared Runners being somewhat slow, we only
run them automatically for MRs, which contain `windows` in the branch
name. Please name your branch accordingly when contributing a patch
which might affect Windows.

#### MSVC

To build Sequoia, you need to have [`capnp`] tool installed.

Only the native Windows Cryptographic API (CNG) is supported, see
**Using Sequoia (Cryptography)** section above.

When building, make sure to disable default features (to disable
Nettle) and enable the CNG via `crypto-cng` Cargo feature:

```bash
$ cargo build --no-default-features --features crypto-cng,compression # Only change crypto backend
```

[`capnp`]: https://capnproto.org/install.html

Bindings
--------

### Python

The FFI crate contains Python bindings.  To disable building, testing,
and installing the Python bindings, use `make PYTHON=disable`.

To build the Python bindings, you will need the Python headers,
setuptools, pip, cffi, and pytest for Python3.

#### Debian

```shell
$ sudo apt install python3-dev python3-setuptools python3-cffi python3-pytest python3-pip
```

#### Fedora

```shell
$ sudo dnf install python3-devel python3-setuptools python3-cffi python3-pytest python3-pip
```

#### macOS (Mojave), using MacPorts

```shell
$ sudo port install py-setuptools py-cffi py-pytest py-pip
```

#### BSD

```shell
# pkg install capnproto coreutils gmake lang/rust llvm nettle pkgconf py37-setuptools py37-pip python3 sqlite
```
